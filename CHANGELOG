BornAgain-1.7.0, released 2016.11.14
  > API changes
    1) The one-argument constructors of FormFactorGauss and FormFactorLorentz now accept a length instead of a volume
    2) GUI project back-compatibility broken
  > Summary:
    1) We moved the source repository from our own server to GitHub,
         https://github.com/scgmlz/BornAgain.
       This makes it easy for external contributors to propose changes in form of pull requests.
       Appveyor and Travis continuous integration server automatize tests.
       Python usage examples are now also covered by tests.
    2) GUI support for fitting real data extended: masking, region of interest, linking dataset to defined instrument.
       Control parameters for different fit engines unified.
    3) Behind the scenes: many directories, files, classes renamed or reorganized.
