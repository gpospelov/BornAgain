\subsection{Position of the problem} 
%===============================================================================


This section describes how assemblies of particles and layers of materials contribute to the scattering cross-section \textit{i.e.} the way their spatial distributions, the distribution of shapes and their correlations or the layers' roughness can influence the output intensity. 

The samples generated with \BornAgain\ are made of different layers of materials characterized by their thicknesses, refractive indices, and possible surface roughnesses. Except for the thickness, the other dimensions of the layers are infinite.\\ Particles can be embedded in or deposited on the top of any layers. Those particles are characterized by their shapes, refractive indices, their spatial distribution and concentration in the sample. The influence of the particles' shapes is described by the form factors. When the particles are densely packed, the distance relative to each other becomes of the same order as the particles' sizes. The radiation scattered from these various particles are going to interfere together. \\ We are first going to give a short overview of the theory involved, mostly in order to define the terminology. For a more complete theoretical description, the user is referred to, for example, reference~\cite{ReLL09} and appendix \ref{app:theory} of this manual. Then we are going to describe how the interference features, the form factors and the characteristics of the material layers have been implemented in \BornAgain\ and  give some examples.

TO MERGE IN:
The scattering length density can be written as:
\begin{equation*}
\rho_s(\vect{r}) = \sum_i \rho_{s,i} S^i(\vect{r}) \otimes \delta (\vect{r}-\vect{R}^i) \; ,
\end{equation*}
with $\rho_{s,i}$ the scattering length density of particle $i$. The cross-section \refeq{xsec1} then becomes:
\begin{align*}
  N\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}(\vect{q}) & = \left\lvert \sum_i F^i(\vect{q}) \exp (i\vect{q}\cdot\vect{R}^i) \right\rvert ^2  \\
  & = \left\lbrace \sum_i \left\lvert F^i(\vect{q}) \right\rvert ^2 + \sum_{i\neq j} F^i(\vect{q}) F^{j*}(\vect{q}) \exp \left[i\vect{q}\cdot (\vect{R}^i-\vect{R}^j)\right] \right\rbrace \; .
\end{align*}
In the last expression, the formfactors $F^i(\vect{q})$ are the Fourier transforms of the shape functions, including their scattering length densities:
\begin{equation*}
  F^i(\vect{q}) \equiv \int d^3\vect{r} \rho_{s,i} S^i(\vect{r}) \exp (i\vect{q}\cdot\vect{r} ) \; .
\end{equation*}


%===============================================================================
\subsection{Collection of particles} \SecLabel{sect:interf}
%===============================================================================

Let us consider the general geometry of a scattering experiment. An incident neutron with a wave vector $\mathbf{k}_i$ is scattered in a new direction $\mathbf{k}_f$ after interacting with a particle. This scattering occurs in a cone of solid angle $d\Omega$ around the direction of the scattered wave vector $\mathbf{k}_f$.
Considering a set of $N$ particles labeled with index $i$, located at $\mathbf{R}_i$ and having shapes $S_i(\mathbf{r})$ ($S_i=0$ outside the particle and 1 inside), occupying a total volume $V$, the differential cross-section per particle is given by:
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}(\vect{q}) = \frac{1}{N}\left\lbrace \sum_i \left\lvert F_i(\vect{q}) \right\rvert ^2 + \sum_{i\neq j} F_i(\vect{q}) F_{j}^*(\vect{q}) \exp \left[i\vect{q}\cdot (\vect{R}_i-\vect{R}_j)\right] \right\rbrace \; .
\end{equation*}
where  $\mathbf{q}=\mathbf{k}_i - \mathbf{k}_f$ is the wave vector transfer and $F_i$ is the form factor of particle $i$ (see \SecRef{sect:ff} for a description).

Since in most experimental conditions only the statistical properties of the particles are known, one can consider the probabilistic value of this cross-section \textit{i.e.} its expectation value. Assuming that the particles' shapes are determined by their class $\alpha$, with the abundance ratio $p_\alpha \equiv N_\alpha / N$, and defining the particle density as $\rho_V \equiv N/V$, the expectation value becomes:
\begin{align*}
  \left\langle \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}(\vect{q}) \right\rangle  & = \sum_\alpha p_\alpha \left\lvert F_\alpha(\vect{q})\right\rvert ^2 + \frac{\rho_V}{V}\sum_{\alpha,\beta} p_\alpha p_\beta F_\alpha (\vect{q})F_\beta^*(\vect{q})  \\
  & \times \iint_V d^3\vect{R}_\alpha d^3\vect{R}_\beta \ppcf{\alpha}{\beta}{R} \exp \left[ i\vect{q}\cdot (\vect{R}_\alpha - \vect{R}_\beta ) \right] \; ,
\end{align*}

where $\ppcf{\alpha}{\beta}{R}$ is called the \emph{partial pair correlation function}. It represents the normalized probability of finding particles of type $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in positions $\vect{R}_\alpha$ and $\vect{R}_\beta$ respectively. 

TO MERGE IN:
More precisely, the probability density for finding a particle $\alpha$ at position $\vect{R}_\alpha$ and another one of type $\beta$ at $\vect{R}_\beta$ is given by:
\begin{equation*}
  \mathcal{P}(\alpha, \vect{R}_\alpha ; \beta , \vect{R}_\beta ) \equiv \rho_V^2 p_\alpha p_\beta \ppcf{\alpha}{\beta}{R} \; .
\end{equation*}


%===============================================================================
\subsection{Size-distribution models}
%===============================================================================

To proceed further, when the morphology and topology are not exactly known, some hypotheses need to be made since the correlation between the kinds of scatterers and their relative positions included in the pair correlation functions are difficult to estimate. Several options are available:

\paragraph{Decoupling approximation (DA)}
\index{Decoupling approximation}
neglects all correlations. It supposes that the particles are positioned in a way that is completely independent on their kinds (shapes, sizes). An example is given in figure~\ref{fig:da}. Thus the kind of scattering objects and their positions are not correlated and the partial pair correlation function is independent of the particle class $\alpha$. We can therefore replace $ \ppcfb{\alpha}{\beta}{R}$ by  $g(\vect{R}_{\alpha\beta})$.

This leads to the following expression of the scattering cross-section:
\begin{equation*}
\left\langle \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}(\vect{q}) \right\rangle  = I_d(\vect{q}) + \left\lvert \left\langle F_\alpha(\vect{q}) \right\rangle_\alpha \right\rvert ^2 \times S(\vect{q}) \; ,
\end{equation*}
where $I_d$ is the diffuse part of the scattering. It is the signature of the fluctuations of shapes, sizes or orientations of the particles; its maximum is located in $q_{\parallel}=0$. In the second term of the expression of the scattering cross-section, $S(\vect{q})$ is the interference function and is given by
\begin{equation*} 
  S(\vect{q}) = 1+ \rho_V \int_V d^3\vect{R} \; g(\vect{R}) \exp \left[ i\vect{q}\cdot \vect{R} \right] \; .
\end{equation*}


\begin{figure}[ht]

\end{center}
\caption{Sketch of a collection of particles deposited on a substrate whose scattering  could be described by the decoupling approximation.}
\label{fig:da}
\end{figure}


In concentrated systems, DA breaks down because of correlations. One solution is to reintroduce some correlations between particles sizes and distributions using, for example, the size spacing correlation approximation described below. 

\paragraph{Local monodisperse approximation (LMA)}
\index{Local monodisperse approximation}
partially accounts for some coupling between the positions and the kinds of the particles \cite{Ped94}. 
 It requires a subdivision of the layers of particles into monodisperse domains. The contributions of these subdomains are then  incoherently summed up and weighted by the size-shape probabilities.\\ In this approximation, a particle is supposed to be surrounded by particles of the same size and shape, within the coherence length of the input beam (see fig.~\ref{fig:lma}). The scattering cross-section is expressed as
\begin{equation*}
  \left\langle \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}(\vect{q}) \right\rangle \simeq \left\langle \left\lvert F_\alpha(\vect{q})\right\rvert ^2 S_\alpha(\vect{q}) \right\rangle_\alpha \; .
\end{equation*}

Contrary to the Decoupling Approximation, the Local Monodisperse Approximation can account for particle class/size/shape-dependent pair correlation functions by having distinct interference functions $S_\alpha(\vect{q})$.

One has to remember that in most cases, this approximation corresponds to an unphysical description of the investigated systems. \\ 

DA and LMA separate the contributions of the form factors and of the interference function. For disordered systems DA and LMA give the same result as the scattering vector gets larger \textit{i.e.} the scattered intensity is dominated by the contribution of the form factor.

\caption{Sketch of a collection of particles deposited on a substrate whose scattering could be described by the local monodisperse correlation approximation. The dashed areas mark the coherent domains. In this case, the total scattering intensity is the incoherent sum from all these domains.}
\label{fig:lma}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Size spacing correlation approximation (SSCA)}
\index{Size-spacing correlation approximation}
introduces correlations between polydisperse particles, more precisely between the size of the particles and their mutual spacing. A classical example would consist in particles whose closest-neighbor spacing depends linearly on the sum of their respective sizes \cite{LaLR07}, as illustrated in fig.~\ref{fig:ssca}.

%For a sample where only the statistical properties of particle positions and size are known, the scattered intensity per scattering particle is expressed as the average over an ensemble of the Fourier transform of the Patterson function, which is the autocorrelation of the scattering length density $\curlp (\vectr ) \equiv \sum_{ij} S_i(-\vectr )\otimes S_j(\vectr )\otimes \delta (\vectr + \vectr_i - \vectr_j )$:
%\begin{equation*}
%  I(\vectq ) = \frac{1}{N}\ensavg{}{\curlf (\curlp (\vectr ))} \; ,
%\end{equation*}
%where $\curlf$ denotes the Fourier transform and $\curlp$ the Patterson function

\MakeRemark{Terminology}{
\\
For collections of particles, the scattered intensity contains contributions from neighboring particles. This additional pattern can be called the structure factor, the interference function or even in crystallography, the lattice factor. In this manual, we use the term "interference function" or interferences.
}


%===============================================================================
\subsection{Layout of particles}\label{sec:partlayout}
%===============================================================================

\subsubsection{The uncorrelated or disordered lattice}
For very diluted distributions of particles, the particles are too far apart from each other to lead to any interference between the waves scattered by each of them. In this case the interference function is equal to 1. The scattered intensity is then entirely determined by the form factors of the particles distributed in the sample.

\subsubsection{The regular  lattice}\mbox{}\\
The particles are positioned at regular intervals generating a layout characterized by its base vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ (in direct space) and the angle between these two vectors.
This lattice can be two or one-dimensional depending on the characteristics of the particles. For example when they are infinitely long, the implementation can be simplified and reduced to a "pseudo" 1D system.

\paragraph{The ideal paracrystal} \mbox{}\\
\index{Paracrystal}
A paracrystal, whose notion was developed by Hosemann\cite{Hos51}, allows fluctuations of the lengths and orientations of lattice vectors. Paracrystals can be defined as distorted crystals in which the crystalline order has not disappeared and for which the behavior of the interference functions  at small angles is coherent.
It is a transition between the regular lattice and the disordered state.\\

For example, in one dimension, a paracrystal is generated using the following method. First we place a particle at the origin. The second particle is put at a distance $x$ with a density probability $p(x)$ that is peaked at a mean value $D$: $\int_{-\infty} ^{\infty}p(x)dx=1$ and $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}xp(x)dx=D$. The third one is added at a distance $y$ from the second site using the same rule with a density probability $p_2(y)= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}p(x)p(y-x)dx=p\otimes p(y)$.\\ With such a method, the pair correlation function $g(x)$ is built step by step. Its expression and the one of its Fourier transform, which is the interference function are 
\begin{equation*}
g(x)=\delta(x)+ p(x)+ p(x)\otimes p(x)+\ldots + p(-x)+\ldots \: \mathrm{and}\:\, S(q)=\Re\left(\dfrac{1+P(q)}{1-P(q)}\right),
\end{equation*}
 where $P(q)$ is the Fourier transform of the density probability $p(x)$.\\

\paragraph{Example} For a probability distribution function is Gaussian:
\begin{equation*}
p(x)=\frac{1}{\omega \sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left(-\dfrac{(x-D)^2}{\omega^2}\right),\qquad P(q)=\exp\left(-\frac{q^2 \omega^2}{2}\right)\exp(iqD).
\end{equation*}
 The interference function of a one-dimensional paracrystal is given by

\begin{align*}
S(q) =\Re \left(\frac{1+\Phi(q) }{1 - \Phi(q)} \right), \quad \mathrm{where}\quad \Phi(q) = P(q)\exp\left(-\frac{D}{\Lambda}\right),
\end{align*}
where $\Lambda$ is a damping length used in order to introduce some finite-size effects.

Figure~\ref{fig:1dparas_q} shows the evolution of $S(q)$ for different values of $\omega /D$. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{fig/funcplot/S_q_1Dparacrystal.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{Interference function of a 1D Gaussian paracrystal plotted for different values of $\omega /D$. The peaks broaden with a decreasing amplitude as $\omega/D$ increases. This shows the transition between an ordered and a disordered states. }
\label{fig:1dparas_q}
\end{figure}

In two dimensions, the paracrystal is constructed on a pseudo-regular lattice with base vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ using the following conditions for the densities of probabilities:\\ $\int p_{\mathbf{a}}(\mathbf{r})d^2\mathbf{r}=\int p_{\mathbf{b}}(\mathbf{r})d^2\mathbf{r}=1$, $\int \mathbf{r} p_{\mathbf{a}}(\mathbf{r})d^2\mathbf{r}=\mathbf{a}$, $\int \mathbf{r} p_{\mathbf{b}}(\mathbf{r})d^2\mathbf{r}=\mathbf{b}$.\\
In the ideal case the deformations along the two axes are decoupled and each unit cell should retain a parallelogram shape. The interference function is given by\\ $S(q_{\parallel})=\prod_{k=a,b}\Re\left(\dfrac{1+P_k(q_{\parallel})}{1-P_k(q_{\parallel})} \right)$ with $P_k$ the Fourier transform of $p_k$, $k=a, b$.

\paragraph{Probability distributions} \mbox{}\\
The scattering by an ordered lattice gives rise to a series of Bragg peaks situated at the nodes of the reciprocal lattice. Any divergence from the ideal crystalline case modifies the output spectrum by, for example, widening or attenuating the Bragg peaks. The influence of these "defects" can be accounted for 
 in direct space by using correlation functions or by truncating the lattice or, in reciprocal space with structure factors or interference functions by convoluting the scattered peaks with a function which could reproduce the experimental shapes.


%===============================================================================
\subsubsection{General formulas}
%===============================================================================

Even in the most general case, the partial pair correlation function will only depend on the difference $\vect{R}_{\alpha\beta}\equiv(\vect{R}_\alpha - \vect{R}_\beta )$ of the particles' positions. One of the volume integrals can then be dropped, together with the volume factor, giving:
\begin{align*}
  \left\langle \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}(\vect{q}) \right\rangle  & = \sum_\alpha p_\alpha \left\lvert F_\alpha(\vect{q})\right\rvert ^2 + \rho_V\sum_{\alpha,\beta} p_\alpha p_\beta F_\alpha (\vect{q})F_\beta^*(\vect{q}) \\
  & \times \int_V d^3\vect{R}_{\alpha\beta} \ppcfb{\alpha}{\beta}{R} \exp \left[ i\vect{q}\cdot \vect{R}_{\alpha\beta} \right] \; .
\end{align*}

This expression can be split into a diffuse part, which by definition should be zero for the case of only one particle type, and a coherent part, resulting from the coherent superposition of scattering amplitudes for particles at different positions:
\begin{equation*}
  \left\langle \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}(\vect{q}) \right\rangle = I_d(\vect{q}) + \ensavg{\alpha\beta}{F_\alpha (\vect{q} ) S_{\alpha\beta} (\vect{q}) F_\beta^* (\vect{q})} \; ,
\end{equation*}
where
\begin{align*}
  I_d(\vect{q}) &\equiv \ensavg{\alpha}{\left\rvert F_\alpha (\vect{q}) \right\rvert^2} - \left\lvert \ensavg{\alpha}{ F_\alpha (\vect{q})} \right\rvert^2 \; , \\
  S_{\alpha\beta} (\vect{q}) &\equiv 1 + \rho_V \int_V d^3\vect{R}_{\alpha\beta}\ppcfb{\alpha}{\beta}{R} \exp \left[ i\vect{q}\cdot \vect{R}_{\alpha\beta} \right] \; .
\end{align*}
$S_{\alpha\beta} (\vect{q})$ is called the \emph{interference function} and $\langle\dotso\rangle_\alpha$ is the expectation value over the classes $\lbrace \alpha\rbrace$.


%===============================================================================
\subsubsection{Decoupling approximation}
%===============================================================================
\index{Decoupling approximation}

When the partial pair correlation function is independent of the particle class $\alpha$ ($ \ppcfb{\alpha}{\beta}{R} \equiv g(\vect{R}_{\alpha\beta})$ ), the scattering cross-section becomes:
\begin{equation*}
\left\langle \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}(\vect{q}) \right\rangle  = I_d(\vect{q}) + \left\lvert \left\langle F_\alpha(\vect{q}) \right\rangle_\alpha \right\rvert ^2 \times S(\vect{q}) \; ,
\end{equation*}
where
\begin{equation*} 
  S(\vect{q}) = 1+ \rho_V \int_V d^3\vect{R} \; g(\vect{R}) \exp \left[ i\vect{q}\cdot \vect{R} \right] \; .
\end{equation*}


%===============================================================================
\subsubsection{Local Monodisperse Approximation}
%===============================================================================
\index{LMA|see {Local monodisperse approximation}}
\index{Local monodisperse approximation}
  
By assuming that inside every coherence region of the beam, the particle class (or size/shape) is fixed, the cross-section will consist of an incoherent superposition of these different coherence regions and can be written as:
\begin{equation*}
  \left\langle \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}(\vect{q}) \right\rangle \simeq \left\langle \left\lvert F_\alpha(\vect{q})\right\rvert ^2 S_\alpha(\vect{q}) \right\rangle_\alpha \; .
\end{equation*}

Contrary to the Decoupling Approximation, the Local Monodisperse Approximation can account for particle class/size/shape-dependent pair correlation functions by having distinct interference functions $S_\alpha(\vect{q})$.


%===============================================================================
\subsubsection{Size-Spacing Correlation Approximation}
%===============================================================================
\index{Size-spacing correlation approximation}
\index{SSCA|see {Size-spacing correlation approximation}}

In the Size-Spacing Correlation Approximation, a correlation is assumed between the shape/size of the particles and their mutual spacing. A classical example would consist of particles whose closest-neighbor spacing depends linearly on the sum of their respective sizes. The following discussion of this type of correlation is inspired by \cite{LaLR07}

The scattered intensity can also be calculated as the Fourier transform of the Patterson function, which is the autocorrelation of the scattering length density:
\begin{equation*}
  \curlp (\vectr ) \equiv \sum_{ij} S_i(-\vectr )\otimes S_j(\vectr )\otimes \delta (\vectr + \vectr_i - \vectr_j ) \; .
\end{equation*}
For a sample where only the statistical properties of particle positions and shape/size are known, the scattered intensity per scattering particle becomes average over an ensemble of the Fourier transform of the Patterson function:
\begin{equation*}
  I(\vectq ) = \frac{1}{N}\ensavg{}{\curlf (\curlp (\vectr ))} \; ,
\end{equation*}
where $\curlf$ denotes the Fourier transform.

The ensemble averaged Patterson function will be denoted as:
\begin{equation*}
  Z(r) \equiv \frac{1}{N}\ensavg{}{\curlp (\vectr )} \; .
\end{equation*}
In the case of systems where the particles are aligned in one dimension, this autocorrelation function can be further split into nearest neighbor probabilities. First, it is split into terms for negative, zero or positive distance:
\begin{equation*}
  Z(\vectr ) \equiv z_0(\vectr ) + z_+(\vectr ) + z_-(\vectr ) \; .
\end{equation*}
Taking $x$ as the coordinate in the direction in which the particles are arranged and $s$ as an orthogonal coordinate ($\vectr \equiv (x,s)$), one obtains:
\begin{align*}
  z_0(\vectr ) &= \sum_{\alpha_0} p(\alpha_0) S_{\alpha_0}(-x,-s) \otimes S_{\alpha_0}(x,s)  \\
  z_+(\vectr ) &= \sum_{\alpha_0\alpha_1} p(\alpha_0,\alpha_1) S_{\alpha_0}(-x,-s) \otimes S_{\alpha_1}(x,s) \otimes P_1(x|\alpha_0\alpha_1)  \\
               &+ \sum_{\alpha_0\alpha_1\alpha_2} p(\alpha_0,\alpha_1,\alpha_2) S_{\alpha_0}(-x,-s) \otimes S_{\alpha_2}(x,s) \otimes P_1(x|\alpha_0\alpha_1) \otimes P_2(x|\alpha_0\alpha_1\alpha_2)  \\
               &+ \dotsb \\
  z_-(\vectr ) &= z_+(-\vectr ) \; ,
\end{align*}
where $p(\alpha_0,\dotsc ,\alpha_n)$ denotes the probability of having a sequence of particles of the indicated sizes/shapes and $P_n(x|\alpha_0\dotsc\alpha_n)$ is the probability density of having a particle of type $\alpha_n$ at a (positive) distance $x$ of its nearest neighbor of type $\alpha_{n-1}$ in a sequence of the given order.

In the Size-Spacing Correlation Approximation, one assumes that the particle sequence probabilities are just a product of their individual fractions:
\begin{equation*}
  p(\alpha_0,\dotsc ,\alpha_n) = \prod_i p(\alpha_i) \; ,
\end{equation*}
and the nearest neighbor distance distribution is dependent only on the two particles involved:
\begin{equation*}
  P_n(x|\alpha_0\dotsc\alpha_n) = P_1(x|\alpha_{n-1}\alpha_n) \; .
\end{equation*}
Furthermore, the distance distribution $P_1(x|\alpha_0\alpha_1)$ depends on the particle sizes/shapes only through its mean value $D$:
\begin{equation*}
  P_1(x|\alpha_0\alpha_1) = P_0(x - D(\alpha_0,\alpha_1) ) \; ,
\end{equation*}
where $D(\alpha_0,\alpha_1) = D_0 + \kappa \left[ \Delta R(\alpha_0) + \Delta R(\alpha_1) \right]$, with $\Delta R(\alpha_i)$ the deviation of a size parameter of particle $i$ with respect to the mean over all particles sizes/shapes and $\kappa$ the coupling parameter.

In momentum space, the sum of convolutions can be written as a geometric series, which can be exactly calculated to be:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sscainf}
  I(\vectq ) = \ensavg{\alpha}{\left| F_\alpha(\vectq ) \right| ^2} + 2 \Re \left\lbrace \widetilde{\curlf_\kappa}(\vectq )\widetilde{\curlf_\kappa^*}(\vectq ) \cdot \frac{\Omega_\kappa(\vectq )}{\tilde{p}_{2\kappa}(\vectq )\left[ 1 - \Omega_\kappa(\vectq )\right] } \right\rbrace \; ,
\end{equation}
with
\begin{align*}
  \tilde{p}_\kappa(\vectq ) &= \int d\alpha\; p(\alpha) e^{i\kappa q_x \Delta R(\alpha)}  \\
  \Omega_\kappa(\vectq ) &= \tilde{p}_{2\kappa}(\vectq ) \phi(\vectq) e^{i q_x D_0}  \\
  \widetilde{\curlf_\kappa}(\vectq ) &= \int d\alpha\; p(\alpha)F_\alpha (\vectq ) e^{i\kappa q_x \Delta R(\alpha)} \; ,
\end{align*}
and the Fourier transform of $P_1(x|\alpha_0\alpha_1)$ is
\begin{equation*}
  \curlp (\vectq ) = \phi (\vectq )e^{i q_x D_0} e^{i \kappa q_x \left[ \Delta R(\alpha_0) + \Delta R(\alpha_1) \right] } \; .
\end{equation*}

Using the result from the one-dimensional analysis, one can apply this formula ad hoc for distributions of particles in a plane, where the coordinate $x$ will now be replaced with $(x,y)$, while the $s$ coordinate encodes a position in the remaining orthogonal direction. One must be aware however that this constitutes a further approximation, since this type of correlation does not have a general solution in more than one dimension.

The intensity in \refeq{sscainf} will contain a Dirac delta function contribution, caused by taking an infinite sum of terms that are perfectly correlated at $\vectq = 0$. One can leverage this behaviour by multiplying the nearest neighbor distribution by a constant factor $e^{-D/\Lambda}$, which removes the division by zero in \refeq{sscainf}.
Another way of dealing with this infinity at $\vectq =0$ consists of taking only a finite number of terms, in which case the geometric series still has an analytic solution, but becomes a bit more cumbersome:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
  I(\vectq ) &= \ensavg{\alpha}{\left| F_\alpha(\vectq ) \right| ^2} + 2 \Re \Biggl\lbrace \frac{1}{\tilde{p}_{2\kappa}(\vectq )}\widetilde{\curlf_\kappa}(\vectq )\widetilde{\curlf_\kappa^*}(\vectq ) \\
  & \times \left[ \left( 1 - \frac{1}{N}\right) \frac{\Omega_\kappa(\vectq )}{1 - \Omega_\kappa(\vectq ) } - \frac{1}{N}\frac{\Omega_\kappa^2(\vectq )\left( 1- \Omega_\kappa^{N-1}(\vectq )\right) }{\left( 1 - \Omega_\kappa(\vectq ) \right) ^2 } \right] \Biggr\rbrace \; .
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
This expression has a well-defined limit for $\Omega_\kappa(\vectq ) \rightarrow 1$ (when $\vectq \rightarrow 0$), namely:
\begin{equation*}
  \lim_{\vectq \rightarrow 0} I(\vectq ) = \ensavg{\alpha}{\left| F_\alpha(0 ) \right| ^2} + \left( N-1 \right) \left| \ensavg{\alpha}{F_\alpha(0 )} \right|^2 \; .
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Vertical location of particles}
%===============================================================================

 \ImportantPoint{Remark:}{The particles cannot sit in between layers. At most they can be sitting on any inner interfaces.}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Particles deposited on a substrate}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%Substrate modified Born approximation
In this configuration, the particles are sitting on top of a substrate layer, in the air as shown in fig.~\ref{fig:SchemDWBA}. In the DWBA the expression of a form factor becomes 
\begin{align}
F_{\rm{DWBA}}(q_{\parallel}, k_{i,z}, k_{f,z}) &= F_{\rm{BA}}(q_{\parallel}, k_{i,z}-k_{f,z})+ R_i F_{\rm{BA}}(q_{\parallel}, -k_{i,z}-k_{f,z}) \nonumber \\
&+ R_f F_{\rm{BA}}(q_{\parallel}, k_{i,z}+k_{f,z}) + R_i R_f F_{\rm{BA}}(q_{\parallel},-k_{i,z}+k_{f,z}), \label{eq:dwbaair}

where $q_{\parallel}$ is the component of the scattering beam in the plane of the interface ($\vect{q}=\vect{k}_i-\vect{k}_f$), $k_{i,z}$ and $k_{f,z}$ are the z-component of the incident and scattered beam, respectively. $R_i$, $R_f$ are the reflection coefficients in incidence and reflection. They are defined as\\ $R=\dfrac{k_z+\sqrt{n_s^2k_0^2-|k_{\parallel}|^2}}{k_z-\sqrt{n_s^2 k_0^2-|k_{\parallel}|^2}}$, where $n_s=1-\delta_s +i \beta_s$ is the refractive index of the substrate, $k_0$ is the wavelength in vacuum ($2\pi /\lambda$), $k_z$ and $k_{\parallel}$ are the $z$-component and the in-plane component of $\vect{k}_i$ or $\vect{k}_f$. \\

\ImportantPoint{Remark:}{If the particles are sitting on a multilayered system, the expression of the form factor in the DWBA is obtained by replacing the Fresnel coefficient by the corresponding coefficients of the underlying layers \cite{Par54,BoWo99}.}

\subsubsection{Buried particles} 
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The system considered in this section consists of particles encapsulated in a layer, which is sitting on a substrate (see fig.~\ref{fig:SchemDWBAburied}). In this case the form factor in the DWBA is given by

\begin{align}
  F_{\rm{DWBA}}(q_{\parallel}, k_{i,z}, k_{f,z})
  &= T_i T_f F_{\rm{BA}}(q_{\parallel}, k_{i,z}-k_{f,z})e^{i(k_{i,z}-k_{f,z})d}\nonumber \\
  &+ R_i T_f F_{\rm{BA}}(q_{\parallel}, -k_{i,z}-k_{f,z})e^{i(-k_{i,z}-k_{f,z})d} \nonumber \\
  &+ R_f T_i F_{\rm{BA}}(q_{\parallel}, k_{i,z}+k_{f,z}) e^{i(k_{i,z}+k_{f,z})d}\nonumber \\
  &+ R_f R_iF_{\rm{BA}}(q_{\parallel},-k_{i,z}+k_{f,z})e^{i(-k_{i,z}+k_{f,z})d}, \label{eq:dwbaburied}
\end{align}

\begin{equation*}
R_j =\frac{t^{j}_{0,1}r^{j}_{1,2}\exp(2ik_{j,z}t)}{1+r^{j}_{0,1}r^{j}_{1,2}\exp(2ik_{j,z}t)}, \quad T_j=\frac{t^{j}_{0,1}}{1+r^{j}_{0,1}r^{j}_{1,2}\exp(2ik_{j,z}t)}, j=i,f 
\end{equation*}
where $q_{\parallel}$ is the component of the scattering beam in the plane of the interface, $k_{i,z}$ and $k_{f,z}$ are the z-component of the incident and scattered beams, respectively.  $d$ is the depth at which the particles are sitting in the layer. Note that this value is given relative to the top of this layer and it is not the coordinate in the absolute referential (linked with the full sample) and it is measured up to the bottom of the particle. $t$ is the thickness of the intermediate layer containing the particles. $R_{i,f}$ and $T_{i,f}$  are the reflection  and transmission coefficients in incidence and reflection (they can be calculated using Parratt or matrix formalism). $r^j_{0,1}$, $r^j_{1,2}$ $t^j_{0,1}$ are the reflection and transmission coefficients between layers; the indices are related to different boundaries with 0: air, 1: intermediate layer and 2: substrate layer and the superscript $j$ is associated with the incident or scattered beams:
\begin{equation*}
r^j_{n,n+1}=\frac{k_{j,z,n}-k_{j,z,n+1}}{k_{j,z,n}-k_{j,z,n+1}}, \qquad t^j_{n,n+1}= \frac{2k_{j,z,n}}{k_{j,z,n}-k_{j,z,n+1}}, \quad n=0,1, \quad j=i,f,
\end{equation*}
where index $n$ is related to the layers, $z$ to the vertical component, and $j$ to the beams (incident and outgoing).

This convention is different for the top air layer, where particles sitting at the interface with an underlying layer (\textit{i.e.} the bottom of the air layer) are located at depth 0 (see fig.~\ref{fig:depthpartBA}).}

%===============================================================================
\subsection{Implementation in \BornAgain}
%===============================================================================

This section describes the implementation of the interference functions in \BornAgain. For an implementation of all the components of a simulation, the use is referred, for example, to \SecRef{Example1Python}.\\


\ImportantPoint{Remark:}{In \BornAgain\ the particles are positioned in the same vertical layer.}

\subsubsection{Size-distribution models}
\index{Size-distribution models}
The decoupling approximation (DA), local monodisperse approximation (LMA) and size spacing correlation approximation (SSCA) can be used in \BornAgain.
The selection between DA and SSCA is made using\\ 
\Code{ILayout.setApproximation(EInterferenceFunction approximation)} when defining the characteristics of the way particles and interference functions are embedded in a layer.  For example,
\begin{lstlisting}[language=python, style=eclipseboxed,numbers=none,nolol]
    particle_layout = ParticleLayout()
   ....
# interference approx chosen between: DA (default) and SSCA
    particle_layout.setApproximation(ILayout.DA)
\end{lstlisting}

Note that with the SSCA, the users have to specify the coupling parameter $\kappa$ (with the function \Code{setKappa}), which should be a positive dimensionless value. $\kappa$ characterizes the influence of the neighboring particles' sizes on their distance. If $\kappa=0$, the SSCA reduces to the DA with a radial paracrystal for the interference function.\\

For the LMA, its implementation is automatically done when using more than one layout of particles:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=python, style=eclipseboxed,numbers=none,nolol]
    particle_layout0 = ParticleLayout()
    particle_layout1 = ParticleLayout()
   ....
# association of each particles' layout with materials, form factors
#... and with a material layer
    layer_a = Layer(m_material_a)
    layer_a.addLayout(particle_layout0)
    layer_a.addLayout(particle_layout1)
\end{lstlisting}

%%ADD EXPLANATION ABOUT LMA

\subsubsection{Probability distribution functions}\label{baftd}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The probability distribution functions have been implemented in the reciprocal space in \BornAgain. Their expressions are given in Table~\ref{table:pdf}.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\hline 
Function & One dimension & Two dimensions\\
\hline 
Cauchy & $(1+q^2\omega^2)^{-3/2}$ & $(1 + q_x^2 cl_x^2 + q_y^2 cl_y^2)^{-3/2}$ \\
Gauss & $\dfrac{1}{2}\exp(-\dfrac{q^2\omega^2}{4})$ & $\frac{1}{2}\exp\left(-\dfrac{q_x^2 cl_x^2+ q_y^2cl_y^2}{4}\right)$ \\
Voigt & $\dfrac{\eta}{2} \exp\left(-\dfrac{q^2\omega^2}{4}\right) + \dfrac{1 - \eta}{(1 + q^2\omega^2)^{3/2}}$ & $\dfrac{\eta}{2} \exp\left(-\dfrac{q_x^2 cl_x^2+ q_y^2cl_y^2}{4}\right)+ \dfrac{1 - \eta}{(1 + q_x^2 cl_x^2+ q_y^2cl_y^2)^{3/2}}$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{List of probability distribution functions in reciprocal space. $\omega$, $cl$ stand for coherence lengths (the index refers to the axis) and  $\eta$ is a weighting coefficient.}
\label{table:pdf}
\end{table}

The Cauchy distribution corresponds to $\exp(-r)$ in real space and the Voigt one  is a linear combination of the Gaussian and Cauchy probability distribution functions.\\

\noindent \underline{One dimension}
\begin{itemize}
\item \Code{FTDistribution1DCauchy($\omega$)},
\item \Code{FTDistribution1DGauss($\omega$)},
\item \Code{FTDistribution1DVoigt($\omega, \eta$)}.
\end{itemize}
where $\omega$ is the coherence length and $\eta$ is a weighting factor.\\

\noindent \underline{Two dimensions}
\begin{itemize}
\item \Code{FTDistribution2DCauchy($cl_x$, $cl_y$)},
\item \Code{FTDistribution2DGauss($cl_x$, $cl_y$)},
\item \Code{FTDistribution2DVoigt($cl_x$, $cl_y$)}
\end{itemize}
where $cl_{x,y}$ are the coherence lengths in the $x$ or $y$ direction, respectively.

These functions can be used with all interference functions, except the case without any interference.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Interferences}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\index{Interference function}

The interference function is specified when building the sample. It is linked with the particles (shape, material). Examples of implementation are given at the end of each description.

\paragraph{Syntax:}
 \Code{particle\_layout.addInterferenceFunction(interference\_function)},\\ where \Code{particle\_layout} holds the information about the different shapes and their proportions for a given layer of particles, and \Code{interference\_function}  is one of the following expressions:
\begin{itemize}
\item \Code{InterferenceFunctionNone()}
\item \Code{InterferenceFunction1DLattice(lattice\_parameters)}
\item \Code{InterferenceFunctionRadialParaCrystal(peak\_distance, damping\_length)}
\item \Code{InterferenceFunction2DLattice(lattice\_parameters)}
\item \Code{InterferenceFunction2DParaCrystal(length\_1, length\_2, $\alpha$\_lattice, $\xi$, \\ damping\_length)}
\end{itemize}

\ImportantPoint{Remark:}{\Code{InterferenceFunction1DLattice} can only be used for particles which are infinitely long in one direction of the sample's surface like for example a rectangular grating.}

\newpage
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{\ding{253} \Code{InterferenceFunctionNone()}} 
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The particles are placed randomly in the dilute limit and are considered as individual, non-interacting scatterers. The scattered intensity is function of the form factors only. 

\paragraph{Example} The sample is made of a substrate on which are deposited half-spheres. Script~\ref{lst:nointerf} details the commands necessary to generate such a sample. Figure~\ref{fig:nointerf} shows an example of output intensity: Script~\ref{lst:nointerf}  + detector's + input beam's characterizations.

\ImportantPoint{Remark:}{By default the long axis of the particles in this 1D lattice is along the beam axis. That is the reason why in the example below the particles are rotated by  $90^{\circ}$ in the $(x,y)$ plane: the main axis of the lattice is therefore parallel to the y-axis, perpendicular to the long axis of the particles.}

\vspace{12pt}
A probability distribution function \Code{pdf} has to be chosen from the list in section~\ref{baftd} in order to apply some modifications to the scattering peaks. This function is implemented using \Code{setProbabilityDistribution(pdf)}. 

\paragraph{Example:} Script~\ref{lst:1dlattinterf} details how to build in  \BornAgain\ a sample using\\ \Code{InterferenceFunction1DLattice} as the interference function. As mentioned previously, this interference function can only be used with infinitely wide or long particles.\\ Here the sample is made of infinitely long boxes deposited on a substrate (these particles are characterized by their widths and heights). They are also rotated by $90^{\circ}$  in the sample surface in order to have their long axis perpendicular to the input beam, which is along the $x$-axis.\\

\subsubsection{\ding{253} \Code{InterferenceFunction2DParaCrystal(L\_1, L\_2, lattice\_angle, $\xi$, damping\_length)}} 
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{itemize}
\item[where] $L_1$, $L_2$ are the lengths of the lattice cell,
\item[] lattice\_angle the angle between the lattice basis vectors $\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}$ in direct space,
\item[] $\xi$ is the angle defining the lattice orientation (set to $0$ by default).
\item[] \Code{damping\_length} is used to introduce finite size effects by applying a multiplicative coefficient equal to  $\exp$(-\Code{peak\_distance/damping\_length}) to the Fourier transform of the probability densities. \Code{damping\_length} is equal to 0 by default and, in this case, no correction is applied.
\end{itemize}
Two predefined interference functions can also be used:
\begin{itemize}
\item  \Code{createSquare(peak\_distance, damping\_length, domain\_size\_1, domain\_size\_2)}\\
where the angle between the base vectors of the lattice is set to $\pi/2$,
it creates a squared lattice,
\item \Code{createHexagonal(peak\_distance, damping\_length, domain\_size\_1, domain\_size\_2)}\\
where the angle between the base vectors of the lattice is set to $2\pi/3$ ,
\end{itemize}
where
\Code{domain\_size1, 2} are the dimensions of coherent domains of the paracrystal along the main axes,\\ \Code{peak\_distance} is the same in both directions and $\mathbf{a}\equiv \mathbf{x}$.\\

Probability distribution functions have to be defined. As the two-dimensional paracrystal is defined from two independent one-dimensional paracrystals, we need two of these functions, using\\ \Code{setProbabilityDistributions(pdf\_1, pdf\_2)}, with \Code{pdf\_{1,2}} related to each main axis of the paracrystal (see figure~\ref{fig:2dparaschematic}).

\caption{Schematics of the ideal 2D paracrystal. The gray-shaded areas mark the regions where the probability to find a node is larger that the width at half-maximum of the distribution. $L$ and  $W$ are the mean inter-node distances along the two crystallographic axes. cl$_{(L,W),(x,y)}$ are the widths of the distribution of distance. The disorder is propagated as we add more nodes. Such a structure would be generated using \Code{InterferenceFunction2DParacrystal(L,W,90.*degrees,0,damp\_length)}, with \Code{pdf$_1$ = FTDistribution2DGauss(cl$_{L,x}$,cl$_{L,y}$)} and  \Code{pdf$_2$ = FTDistribution2DGauss(cl$_{W,x}$,cl$_{W,y}$)}.}

\paragraph{Example} The particles deposited on a substrate are half-spheres. The scattered beams interference via the 2DParacrystal distribution function. The paracrystal is based on a 2D hexagonal lattice with a Gaussian probability distribution function in reciprocal space.  Script~\ref{lst:2dparainterf} shows the implementation of the interference function and fig.~\ref{fig:2ddl} an example of output intensity using hemi-spherical particles.
