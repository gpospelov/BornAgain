\chapter{Simulating a GISAS experiment}  \label{sec:Exp}

To fit experimental data, it is not sufficient to simulate
the scattering of plane waves by the sample.
To account for actual detector images,
we must account for the finite instrument resolution,
and compute detector images in appropriate coordinates.

%In this section we describe the conversion between the scattering vector~$\q$
%and the experimental coordinates.

%The experimental geometry has already been introduced in \cref{fig:expgeom}.
