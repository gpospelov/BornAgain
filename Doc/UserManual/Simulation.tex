\section{General methodology}
A simulation of GISAXS using \BornAgain\ consists of following steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item define materials by specifying name and refractive index,
\item define embedded particles by specifying shape, size,
   constituting material, interference function,
\item define layers by specifying thickness, roughness, material,
\item include particles in layers, specifying density, position, orientation, 
\item assemble a multilayered sample,
\item specify input beam and detector characteristics,
\item run the simulation,
\item save the simulated detector image.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
We are planing to organize all these steps in a graphical user interface (GUI).
For the time being, however, \BornAgain\ must be used via a \Code{C++} program or
\Code{Python} scripts. In the following, we describe how to write a 
\Code{Python} script which runs a \BornAgain\ simulation. For tutorials about this programming language, the users are referred to \cite{Lut09}.


More information about the general software architecture and \BornAgain\ internal design are given in \SecRef{SoftwareArchitecture}.


\section{Geometry of the sample}

\noindent The geometry used to describe the sample is shown in \reffig{multil3d}. The $z$-axis is perpendicular to the sample's
surface and pointing upwards. The $x$-axis  is perpendicular to the
detector plane. The input and the
scattered output beams are each characterized by two angles
$\alpha_i$, $\phi_i$ and $\alpha_f$, $\phi_f$, respectively. Our choice of orientation for the
angles $\alpha_i$ and $\alpha_f$ is so that they are positive as shown in \reffig{multil3d}. \\

    the refractive index of layer $j$ and $\alpha_i$ and $\phi_i$ are the incident
    angles of the wave propagating. $\alpha_f$ is the exit angle with respect to the sample's surface and
$\phi_f$ is the scattering angle with respect to the scattering
plane. }

The layers are defined by their thicknesses (parallel to the
$z$-direction), their possible
roughnesses (equal to 0 by default) and the
materials they are made of. They have an infinite extension in the $x$ and $y$
directions. And, except for roughness, their interfaces are plane and
perpendicular to the $z$-axis. There is also no limitation to the
number of layers that could be defined in \BornAgain. Note that the
thickness of the top and bottom layer are not defined.

%\ImportantPoint{Remark:}{Order of layers: \\
%When assembling the sample, the layers are defined from top to
%bottom. So in most cases the first layer will be the air layer.}\\

The nanoparticles are characterized by their form factors
(\textit{i.e.} the Fourier transform of the shape function - see Appendix~\ref{appendixff} for a list of form factors implemented in \BornAgain) and the composing material. The number of input parameters for the form factor depends on the particle symmetry; it ranges from one parameter for a sphere (its radius) to three for an ellipsoid (its three main axis lengths).
  
By placing the particles
inside or on top of a layer, we impose their vertical positions, whose
values correspond to the bottoms of the particles. The in-plane distribution of particles is linked with the way the
particles interfere with each other. It is therefore implemented
when dealing with the interference function.

%\ImportantPoint{Remark:}{Depth of particles\\
%The vertical positions of particles in a layer are given in relative
%coordinates. For the top layer, the bottom corresponds to
%\texttt{depth}=0. But for all the other layers, it is the top of the
%layer which corresponds to \texttt{depth}=0.}\\

The complex refractive index associated with a layer or a particle is written as $n=1-\delta +i\beta$, with
$\delta, \beta \in \mathbb{R}$. In our program, we input $\delta$ and
$\beta$ directly.


\noindent The input beam is assumed to be monochromatic without any
spatial divergence.\\ %\textbf{polarization term?}

\paragraph{Units:} 

By default the angles are expressed in radians and the lengths are given in
nanometers.  But it is possible to use other units by
specifying them right after the value of the corresponding
parameter like, for example, \Code{20.0*micrometer}.
