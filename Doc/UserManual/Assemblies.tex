In many important GISAS applications,
fluctuations of the refractive index are due to
\E{droplets}, \E{islands}, \E{inclusions} or \E{holes}

of a mesoscopic size (nanometer to micrometer).
In the following, all such inhomogeneities will be described as
\E{particles} that are embedded in a material layer.

\Work
{Documentation on inter-particle correlations is under preparation.
\BornAgain\ currently offers the same choice of models as \IsGISAXS.
Therefore, for the moment we refer to the \IsGISAXS\ manual \cite{Laz08}.}

\iffalse
Our derivation of the DWBA (Sec.~\ref{Sdwba}) has shown
that the distinction between refraction and reflection on the one hand
and scattering on the other hand is not a fundamental one,
but to a certain degree arbitrary:
In (\ref{EHelmholtzGraded}) we have some freedom to assign
inhomogeneities of the scattering length density
either to the averaged refractive index in the
homogeneous wave propagation equation,
or to the perturbative potential.
Therefore it is legitimate
to describe \E{dilute} embedded particles
as scattering centers that otherwise do not affect the propagating waves.
For GISAS by \E{concentrated} particles, however,
one must expect multiple scattering to invalidate this approach.
It seems preferable to take the embedded particles into account
when computing the average refractive index,
which then leads to refraction and reflection caused conjointly
by embedding material (``matrix'') and embedded particles.
\index{Matrix!embedding}%
The downside is that one has then scattering contribution
from both the matrix and the particles.

In general, therefore, the average squared refractive index~$\nz(z)$
used in~(\ref{EHelmholtzGraded})
does not equal the value $n_\text{m}^2(z)$ of the matrix,
but also includes contributions from the particles.
If there is but one species $p$ of particles
\nomenclature[2p010 0]{$p$}{Index of embedded particle species}%
with constant refractive index $n_\text{p}$,
then
\begin{equation}\label{Enzx}
  \nz(z) = [1-x_\text{p}(z)]\,n_\text{m}^2(z) + x_\text{p}(z)\, n_\text{p}^2,
\end{equation}
where $x_\text{p}(z)$ is the volume fraction occupied by the particles.
This equation can be generalized in obvious ways
when there are different types of particles,
or when the refractive index is not constant within the particles.

\mdbreakoff
\Note{\indent \BornAgain\ for the moment only supports discrete layers.
  Within one layer~$\il$,
  the refractive index of the matrix must be constant,
  $n_\text{m}(z)\eqqcolon n_l$.}
%\footnote
%  {The same holds for \IsGisaxs.
%    We are not aware of any software that implements (\ref{Enzx}).}}

Since we have some freedom in shuffling inhomogeneity
between refraction/reflection and scattering,
we are not obliged to compute $\nz(z)$ \E{exactly},
but are allowed to choose some approximation.
In particular, we may average~$x_\text{p}(z)$
over one layer
so that $\nz(z)\eqqcolon \overline{n_\il^2}$ becomes $z$ independent.

\Warn{\indent Currently, \BornAgain\ only supports
  the dilute-particle limit. Whatever the actual particle concentration,
  the approximation $x_\text{p}(z)=0$ is used so that $\overline{n_\il^2}\equiv n_\il^2$.}

Once $\nz(z)$ is computed in whatever approximation,
the perturbation potential is given by (\ref{EChiGraded}),
which takes the form
\begin{equation}
  \chi_\text{p}(\r) \coloneqq  \frac{K^2}{4\pi}\left(\nz(z)-n_\text{p}^2(\r)\right)
\end{equation}
for the particles, and similarly $\chi_\text{m}(z)$ for the matrix.
The overall potential
\begin{equation}
  \chi(\r)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
  \chi_\text{p}(\r)&\text{~if $\r$ in particle,}\\[.2ex]
  \chi_\text{m}(z) &\text{~otherwise,} \end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
\nomenclature[1χ032 0]{$\chi_\text{m}(z)$}{Perturbative potential of embedding material (``matrix'')}%
\nomenclature[1χ032 2p010]{$\chi_\text{p}(\r)$}{Perturbative potential of embedded particles of type~$p$}%
can be rearranged as
\begin{equation}\label{Echi0p}
  \chi(\r)=\chi_\text{m}(z) + \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
  \tilde\chi_\text{p}(\r)&\text{~if $\r$ in particle,}\\[.2ex]
  0 &\text{~otherwise,} \end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
with the renormalized particle potential
\begin{equation}
  \tilde\chi_\text{p}(\r)
  \coloneqq  \chi_\text{p}(\r)-\chi_\text{m}(z)
  = \frac{K^2}{4\pi}\left(n_\text{m}^2(z)-n_\text{p}^2(\r)\right),
\end{equation}
\nomenclature[1χ033 2p010]{$\tilde\chi_\text{p}(\r)$}{Renormalized perturbative potential of embedded particles of type~$p$}%
which vanishes unless $\r$ lies within a particle.

Writing the potential as~(\ref{Echi0p}) is a convenient starting point
for computing the matrix element~$\bra\psi_\ti|\chi|\psi_\tf\ket$.
We now definitively specialize to the case of discrete layers~$\il$
with constant~$\nz(z)=\nzj$.
Hence the $\psi_{w}$ consist of plane waves,
and $\bra\psi_\ti|\chi|\psi_\tf\ket$ is given by (\ref{Edwba_ml}).
We only need to compute the restricted Fourier transform
$\chi_\il(\q)$ introduced in (\ref{Echij}).
According to (\ref{Echi0p}),
it has two contributions,
\begin{equation}\label{Echijmp}
  \chi_\il(\q) = \chi_\text{m}(\q) + \chi_\text{p}(\q).
\end{equation}
The first one is the shape transform of the entire layer,
\begin{equation}
  \chi_\text{m}(\q)
  = \chi_\text{m} \int_{z_\il}^{z_{\il-1}}\!\d z \int\!\d^2r_\plll\, \e^{i\v{q}\,\r}
  = \chi_\text{m} \delta(\q_\plll) \sinc\left( q_\perp z \right).
\end{equation}
Thanks to the delta function,
this term only contributes to the off-specular scattering.
\Work{But what about the mixed terms
  $\chi_\text{p}^*\chi_\text{m} + \text{c.c.}$?}
\Warn{Since $\chi_\text{m}=0$ in BornAgain,
  $\chi_\text{m}(\q)$ is not considered any further.}

The second term in (\ref{Echijmp}) describes the scattering
by the embedded particles.
To proceed, we need to model their scattering properties
and spatial distribution.
A single particle~$i$ shall be characterized by its location~$\R_i$,
and by a parameter vector~$\v{T}_i$ that collects
characteristics like shape, size, orientation, and refractive index profile.
The potential of all particles can then be written as a sum
\begin{equation}
  \chi_\text{p}(\r) = \sum_i \chi(\r-\R_i,\v{T}_i).
\end{equation}
We further introduce the \E{form factor}
\index{Form factor}%
of a particle,
made of a material
with average renormalized perturbation potential~$\tilde\chi$,
\begin{equation}\label{EFFdef}
  F(\q,\v{T}_i) \coloneqq  \int\!\d^3r\,\e^{i\q\r}\chi(\r,\v{T}_i)/\tilde\chi,
\end{equation}
and obtain
\begin{equation}
  \chi_\text{p}(\q) = \sum_i \e^{i\q\R_i} \tilde\chi F(\q,\v{T}_i).
\end{equation}
With (\ref{Exsection}) and (\ref{Edwba_ml}),
the differential cross section due to scattering from embedded particles is
given by double sums over layers, DWBA terms, and particles:
\begin{equation}\label{Eass6}
  \frac{\partial\sigma}{\partial\Omega}
  = \sum_{lm} \sum_{uv} C^{u*}_l C^v_m \sum_{ij} \tilde\chi^2
    \e^{-i\q^u \R_i +i \q^v \R_j} F^*(\q^u,\v{T}_i) F(\q^v,\v{T}_j).
\end{equation}
Motivated by the $\q$ decomposition (\ref{Eqpp}),
we absorb the vertical particle coordinate~$\R_{i\perp}$
into the parameter vector~$\v{T}_i$.
We then collect several terms into the \E{DWBA form factor}\footnote
{This generalizes the definition in \IsGISAXS\ \cite[Sec.~2.4.1]{Laz08}
  \index{IsGISAXS@\string\IsGISAXS!DWBA form factor}%
  and in the literature \cite[p.~292]{ReLL09},
which does not include a depth factor.}
\begin{equation}
  \FD_l(\k_\ti,\k_\tf;\v{T}_i)
  \coloneqq  \sum_u C^u_l\tilde\chi \e^{iq^u_\perp R_{i\perp}} F(\q^u,\v{T}_i).
\end{equation}
In the following, the dependence on the external parameters
$\k_\ti$ and $\k_\tf$ shall be understood implicitly.
Hence (\ref{Eass6}) can be written as
\begin{equation}\label{Eass4}
  \frac{\partial\sigma}{\partial\Omega}
  = \sum_{lm} \sum_{ij} \e^{-i\q_{l\plll}\R_{i\plll}+i\q_{m\plll}\R_{j\plll}}
    \FD^*_l(\v{T}_i) \FD_m(\v{T}_j).
\end{equation}

\Warn{\indent Currently, \BornAgain\ does not support interferences
  between particles in different layers.
  This means in particular that there is no way to model particles
  that extend beyond layer interfaces.}
With this restriction, (\ref{Eass4}) becomes an incoherent sum
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial\sigma}{\partial\Omega}
  = \sum_{l} \left.\frac{\partial\sigma}{\partial\Omega}\right|_l
\end{equation}
  \index{IsGISAXS@\IsGISAXS!particle assemblies}%
over contributions from different layers,\footnote
{This generalizes Eq.~(2.6) of the \IsGISAXS\ manual \cite{Laz08}.}
\Emph{
\begin{equation}\label{Eass3}
  \left.\frac{\partial\sigma}{\partial\Omega}\right|_l
  = \sum_{ij} \e^{i\q_{l\plll}(-\R_{i\plll}+\R_{j\plll})}
    \FD^*_l(\v{T}_i) \FD_l(\v{T}_j).
\end{equation}
\vspace*{-5pt}}

If the morphology of a sample is known from experiments
(e.g.\ transmission electron microscopy) or from simulations,
one could use a straightforward evaluation of~(\ref{Eass3})
to predict the scattering pattern
for a given set of particle coordinates $\{\R_i,\v{T}_i\}$.

Instead, \BornAgain\ provides various physical models
for the distribution of $\R_i$ and $\v{T}_i$.
Except if uniform particles form a perfect two-dimensional crystal,
some degrees of freedom will be more or less disordered.
Therefore models need to be formulated in statistical language.
That formalism is versatile enough to also cover any degree of order.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Decoupling approximations}\label{Spartidis}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To prepare a statistical formulation,
we encode the particle coordinates in a distribution function
\index{Distribution function!embedded particles}%
\index{Particles!distribution function}%
\index{Statistics!particle distribution}%
\begin{equation}\label{EPDdeltas}
  \PD_{l}(\r,\v\tau,\v\tau')
  = \sum_{ij} \delta(\r-(\R_{i\plll}-\R_{j\plll}))
  \delta(\v\tau-\v{T}_i)\delta(\v\tau'-\v{T}_j).
\end{equation}
Since in the following we are concerned with only one layer,
we shall omit the index~$l$ from $\q_{l\plll}$, $\PD_l$, and $\FD_l$.
Let $d_T$ be the dimensionality of~$\v{T}$.
The differential cross section~(\ref{Eass3}) becomes
\begin{equation}\label{Epdm1}
  \left.\frac{\partial\sigma}{\partial\Omega}\right|_l
  =
  \int\!\d^2r\,   \e^{i\q_{\plll}\r}\!
  \int\! \d^{d_T}\tau\, \d^{d_T}\tau'
    \PD(\r,\v\tau,\v\tau')
    \FD^*(\v\tau) \FD(\v\tau'),
\end{equation}
where the integration over $\r$ is restricted to the horizontal plane.

In the following, we will present different physical models
that provide computable approximations
for the formally exact distribution~(\ref{EPDdeltas}).
All these models are based on the following assumptions
about the particle \E{properties} like shape, size, and orientation
(but \E{not} position) that are  encoded in the vector~$\v T_i$:
\Note{\textbf{T-T decoupling approximation:}
Properties of different particles are not correlated.}
\index{T-T decoupling approximation}%
\Note{\textbf{T-R decoupling approximation:}
Particle properties do not depend on position.}
\index{T-R decoupling approximation}%
In consequence, the $\v T_i$
are independent and identically distributed (\E{i.i.d.}) random variables.
They all have the same distribution~$p(\v\tau)$.
For $\r\ne0$, the distribution $\PD$ factorizes as
\begin{equation}
  \PD(\r,\v\tau,\v\tau')\eqqcolon\GD(\r|\v\tau,\v\tau')p(\v\tau)p(\v\tau'),
\end{equation}
which defines the conditional position correlation function~$\GD$.
The case $\r=0$ (equivalent with $i=j$) needs special consideration,
which leads the decomposition
\Emph
{\begin{equation}
  \left.\frac{\partial\sigma}{\partial\Omega}\right|_l
  = I_\text{d}+I_\text{c}.
\end{equation}\vskip -5pt}
We denote averages under~$p(\v\tau)$ as
\begin{equation}
  \bra\FD\ket \coloneqq  \int\!\d^{d_T}\v\tau\,p(\v\tau)\FD(\tau),
\end{equation}
so that the \E{diffuse} scattering intensity assumes the simple form
\index{Diffuse scattering}%
\index{Scattering!diffuse}%
\Emph
{\begin{equation}
  I_\text{d} = \bra\FD^2\ket-{\bra\FD\ket}^2.
\end{equation}\vskip -5pt}
The \E{coherent} scattering intensity is given by
\Emph
{\begin{equation}
  I_\text{c} =
  \int\!\d^2r\,   \e^{i\q_{\plll}\r}\!
  \int\! \d^{d_T}\tau\, \d^{d_T}\tau'
    \GD(\r|\v\tau,\v\tau')p(\v\tau)\FD(\tau)
    \FD^*(\v\tau) \FD(\v\tau').
\end{equation}\vskip -5pt}

Only a few paracrystal models actually specify
a conditioning of~$\GD$ on the particle properties~$\v\tau,\v\tau'$.
For all other models, we assume the
\Note{\textbf{R-T decoupling approximation:}
\index{R-T decoupling approximation}%
Particle positions do not depend on properties.}
Hence simply $\GD(\r|\v\tau,\v\tau')=\GD(\r)$.
To distinguish $\GD(\r)$ from the standard \E{pair correlation function}
\index{Pair correlation function}%
at atomic level, we will call it the
\E{particle position correlation function}.
\index{Particle position correlation function}%
Its Fourier transform
\begin{equation}
  \SD(\q)\coloneqq   \int\!\d^2r\,   \e^{i\q_{\plll}\r}\!   \GD(\r)
\end{equation}
shall be called the \E{interference function}.
\index{Interference function}%.
It is the two-dimensional, mesoscale equivalent of
the atomic \E{static structure factor}
\index{Static structure factor}%
(in crystallography also called \E{lattice factor}).
\index{Lattice factor}%
The coherent scattering intensity then takes the simple form
and therefore
\Emph
{\begin{equation}
  I_\text{c} = \SD(\q) {\bra\FD\ket}^2.
\end{equation}\vskip -5pt}

Altogether, the approximations introduced so far
(coherent superposition; uncorrelated particle properties;
R-T decoupling)
make up the \E{decoupling approximation}
\index{IsGISAXS@\IsGISAXS!decoupling approximation}
of \IsGISAXS.\footnote
{In the \IsGISAXS\ manual \cite[Sec.~2.2]{Laz08},
the \E{decoupling approximation} (DA),
\index{Decoupling approximation}%
\index{DA|see {Decoupling approximation}}%
is opposed to the
\E{local monodisperse approximation} (LMA)
\index{Local monodisperse approximation}%
\index{LMA|see {Local monodisperse approximation}}%
and the
\E{size-spacing correlation approximation} (SSCA).
\index{Size-spacing correlation approximation}%
\index{SSCA|see {Size-spacing correlation approximation}}%
We can now disentangle this skew trichotomy:
The LMA is opposite to coherent superposition;
it describes the incoherent average of
scattering from different coherence domains.
In \BornAgain,
it can be emulated by averaging over different simulated GISAS images
(as described in Sec.~\ref{Scoherlen}),
or by attaching different \texttt{ParticleLayout}s to a \texttt{Layer}.
The SSCA is an alternative to the R-T decoupling approximation.
In \IsGISAXS, and similarly in \BornAgain,
it is only available for paracrystals

The nanoparticles are characterized by their form factors
(\idest the Fourier transform of the shape function - see Appendix~\ref{app:ff} for a list of form factors implemented in \BornAgain) and the composing material.


\Note{\indent
The vertical positions of particles in a layer are given in relative
coordinates. For the top layer, the bottom corresponds to
\texttt{depth}=0. But for all the other layers, it is the top of the
layer which corresponds to \texttt{depth}=0.}

%===============================================================================
\subsection{Collection of particles} \label{sec:sect:interf}
%===============================================================================

Since in most experimental conditions only the statistical properties of the particles are known, one can consider the probabilistic value of this cross-section \idest its expectation value. Assuming that the particles' shapes are determined by their class $\alpha$, with the abundance ratio $p_\alpha \equiv N_\alpha / N$, and defining the particle density as $\rho_V \equiv N/V$, the expectation value becomes:
\begin{align*}
  \bra \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}(\q) \ket  & = \sum_\alpha p_\alpha \left\lvert F_\alpha(\q)\right\rvert ^2 + \frac{\rho_V}{V}\sum_{\alpha,\beta} p_\alpha p_\beta F_\alpha (\q)F_\beta^*(\q)  \\
  & \times \iint_V d^3\v{R}_\alpha d^3\v{R}_\beta \ppcf{\alpha}{\beta}{R} \exp \left[ i\q\cdot (\v{R}_\alpha - \v{R}_\beta ) \right],
\end{align*}


where $\ppcf{\alpha}{\beta}{R}$ is called the \emph{partial pair correlation function}. It represents the normalized probability of finding particles of type $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in positions $\v{R}_\alpha$ and $\v{R}_\beta$ respectively.

TO MERGE IN:

\begin{align*}
  & \bra \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}(\k_\ti,\k_\tf) \ket_{\text{Off-specular}}  \\
  & = \sum_\alpha p_\alpha \left\lvert \curlf_\alpha(\k_{j,i},\k_{j,f}, R_{\alpha,z})\right\rvert ^2 + \frac{\rho_S}{S}\sum_{\alpha,\beta} p_\alpha p_\beta \curlf_\alpha (\k_{j,i},\k_{j,f}, R_{\alpha,z})\curlf_\beta^*(\k_{j,i},\k_{j,f}, R_{\beta,z}) \\
  & \times \iint_S d^2r_\alpha^\plll d^2r_\beta^\plll \ppcf{\alpha}{\beta}{R^\plll} \exp \left[ i\v{q}_{j\plll}\cdot (\r_\alpha^\plll - \r_\beta^\plll ) \right].
\end{align*}


TO MERGE IN:
This expression can be split into a diffuse part, which by definition should be zero for the case of only one particle type, and a coherent part, resulting from the coherent superposition of scattering amplitudes for particles at different positions:
\begin{equation*}
  \bra \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}(\q) \ket
  = I_d(\q) + {\bra F_\alpha (\q ) S_{\alpha\beta} (\q) F_\beta^* (\q)
               \ket}_{\alpha\beta},
\end{equation*}
where
\begin{align*}
  I_d(\q) &
  \equiv {\bra\left\rvert F_\alpha (\q) \right\rvert^2\ket}_{\alpha}
       - \left\lvert {\bra F_\alpha (\q)\ket}_{\alpha} \right\rvert^2, \\
  S_{\alpha\beta} (\q) &\equiv 1 + \rho_V \int_V d^3\r\mathcal{G}_{\alpha\beta}(\r) \exp \left[ i\q\cdot \r \right].
\end{align*}
$S_{\alpha\beta} (\q)$ is called the \emph{interference function} and $\bra\dotso\ket_\alpha$ is the expectation value over the classes $\lbrace \alpha\rbrace$.


TO MERGE IN:
More precisely, the probability density for finding a particle $\alpha$ at position $\v{R}_\alpha$ and another one of type $\beta$ at $\v{R}_\beta$ is given by:
\begin{equation*}
  \mathcal{P}(\alpha, \v{R}_\alpha ; \beta , \v{R}_\beta ) \equiv \rho_V^2 p_\alpha p_\beta \ppcf{\alpha}{\beta}{R}.
\end{equation*}

To proceed further, when the morphology and topology are not exactly known, some hypotheses need to be made since the correlation between the kinds of scatterers and their relative positions included in the pair correlation functions are difficult to estimate. Several options are available:

\section{Layout of particles}\label{sec:partlayout}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%===============================================================================
\subsection{The uncorrelated or disordered lattice}
%===============================================================================
For very diluted distributions of particles, the particles are too far apart from each other to lead to any interference between the waves scattered by each of them. In this case the interference function is equal to 1. The scattered intensity is then entirely determined by the form factors of the particles distributed in the sample.

%===============================================================================
\subsection{The regular lattice and the ideal paracrystal}
%===============================================================================
The particles are positioned at regular intervals generating a layout characterized by its base vectors $\v{a}$ and $\v{b}$ (in direct space) and the angle between these two vectors.
This lattice can be two or one-dimensional depending on the characteristics of the particles. For example when they are infinitely long, the implementation can be simplified and reduced to a "pseudo" 1D system.

\index{Paracrystal}
A paracrystal, whose notion was developed by Hosemann\cite{Hos51}, allows fluctuations of the lengths and orientations of lattice vectors. Paracrystals can be defined as distorted crystals in which the crystalline order has not disappeared and for which the behavior of the interference functions  at small angles is coherent.
It is a transition between the regular lattice and the disordered state.\\

For example, in one dimension, a paracrystal is generated using the following method. First we place a particle at the origin. The second particle is put at a distance $x$ with a density probability $p(x)$ that is peaked at a mean value $D$: $\int_{-\infty} ^{\infty}p(x)dx=1$ and $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}xp(x)dx=D$. The third one is added at a distance $y$ from the second site using the same rule with a density probability $p_2(y)= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}p(x)p(y-x)dx=p\otimes p(y)$.\\ With such a method, the pair correlation function $g(x)$ is built step by step. Its expression and the one of its Fourier transform, which is the interference function are
\begin{equation*}
g(x)=\delta(x)+ p(x)+ p(x)\otimes p(x)+\ldots + p(-x)+\ldots \: \mathrm{and}\:\, S(q)=\Re\left(\dfrac{1+P(q)}{1-P(q)}\right),
\end{equation*}
 where $P(q)$ is the Fourier transform of the density probability $p(x)$.\\

\paragraph{Example} For a probability distribution function is Gaussian:
\begin{equation*}
p(x)=\frac{1}{\omega \sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left(-\dfrac{(x-D)^2}{\omega^2}\right),\qquad P(q)=\exp\left(-\frac{q^2 \omega^2}{2}\right)\exp(iqD).
\end{equation*}
 The interference function of a one-dimensional paracrystal is given by

\begin{align*}
S(q) =\Re \left(\frac{1+\Phi(q) }{1 - \Phi(q)} \right), \quad \mathrm{where}\quad \Phi(q) = P(q)\exp\left(-\frac{D}{\Lambda}\right),
\end{align*}
where $\Lambda$ is a damping length used in order to introduce some finite-size effects.

Figure~\ref{fig:1dparas_q} shows the evolution of $S(q)$ for different values of $\omega /D$.

\begin{figure}[tb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{fig/funcplot/S_q_1Dparacrystal.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{Interference function of a 1D Gaussian paracrystal plotted for different values of $\omega /D$. The peaks broaden with a decreasing amplitude as $\omega/D$ increases. This shows the transition between an ordered and a disordered states. }
\label{fig:1dparas_q}
\end{figure}

In two dimensions, the paracrystal is constructed on a pseudo-regular lattice with base vectors $\v{a}$ and $\v{b}$ using the following conditions for the densities of probabilities:\\ $\int p_{\v{a}}(\r)d^2r=\int p_{\v{b}}(\r)d^2r=1$, $\int \r p_{\v{a}}(\r)d^2r=\v{a}$, $\int \r p_{\v{b}}(\r)d^2r=\v{b}$.\\
In the ideal case the deformations along the two axes are decoupled and each unit cell should retain a parallelogram shape. The interference function is given by\\ $S(q_{\plll})=\prod_{k=a,b}\Re\left(\dfrac{1+P_k(q_{\plll})}{1-P_k(q_{\plll})} \right)$ with $P_k$ the Fourier transform of $p_k$, $k=a, b$.

\paragraph{Probability distributions} \mbox{}\\
The scattering by an ordered lattice gives rise to a series of Bragg peaks situated at the nodes of the reciprocal lattice. Any divergence from the ideal crystalline case modifies the output spectrum by, for example, widening or attenuating the Bragg peaks. The influence of these "defects" can be accounted for
 in direct space by using correlation functions or by truncating the lattice or, in reciprocal space with structure factors or interference functions by convoluting the scattered peaks with a function which could reproduce the experimental shapes.

\subsection{Size-Spacing Correlation Approximation}
%===============================================================================
\index{Size-spacing correlation approximation}

TO MERGE IN:
introduces correlations between polydisperse particles, more precisely between the size of the particles and their mutual spacing. A classical example would consist in particles whose closest-neighbor spacing depends linearly on the sum of their respective sizes \cite{LaLR07}, as illustrated in fig.~\ref{fig:ssca}.

%For a sample where only the statistical properties of particle positions and size are known, the scattered intensity per scattering particle is expressed as the average over an ensemble of the Fourier transform of the Patterson function, which is the autocorrelation of the scattering length density $\curlp (\r ) \equiv \sum_{ij} S_i(-\r )\otimes S_j(\r )\otimes \delta (\r + \r_i - \r_j )$:
%\begin{equation*}
%  I(\q ) = \frac{1}{N}\ensavg{}{\curlf (\curlp (\r ))},
%\end{equation*}
%where $\curlf$ denotes the Fourier transform and $\curlp$ the Patterson function

\begin{figure}[tb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{fig/drawing/drawingSSCA.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{Sketch of a 1D distributed collection of particles, whose scattering could be described by the size-spacing correlation approximation: the distance between two particles depends on their sizes.}
\label{fig:ssca}
\end{figure}


In the Size-Spacing Correlation Approximation, a correlation is assumed between the shape/size of the particles and their mutual spacing. A classical example would consist of particles whose closest-neighbor spacing depends linearly on the sum of their respective sizes. The following discussion of this type of correlation is inspired by \cite{LaLR07}

The scattered intensity can also be calculated as the Fourier transform of the Patterson function, which is the autocorrelation of the scattering length density:
\begin{equation*}
  \curlp (\r ) \equiv \sum_{ij} S_i(-\r )\otimes S_j(\r )\otimes \delta (\r + \r_i - \r_j ).
\end{equation*}
For a sample where only the statistical properties of particle positions and shape/size are known, the scattered intensity per scattering particle becomes average over an ensemble of the Fourier transform of the Patterson function:
\begin{equation*}
  I(\q ) = \frac{1}{N}\bra\curlf (\curlp (\r ))\ket,
\end{equation*}
where $\curlf$ denotes the Fourier transform.

The ensemble averaged Patterson function will be denoted as:
\begin{equation*}
  Z(r) \equiv \frac{1}{N}\bra\curlp (\r )\ket.
\end{equation*}
In the case of systems where the particles are aligned in one dimension, this autocorrelation function can be further split into nearest neighbor probabilities. First, it is split into terms for negative, zero or positive distance:
\begin{equation*}
  Z(\r ) \equiv z_0(\r ) + z_+(\r ) + z_-(\r ).
\end{equation*}
Taking $x$ as the coordinate in the direction in which the particles are arranged and $s$ as an orthogonal coordinate ($\r \equiv (x,s)$), one obtains:
\begin{align*}
  z_0(\r ) &= \sum_{\alpha_0} p(\alpha_0) S_{\alpha_0}(-x,-s) \otimes S_{\alpha_0}(x,s)  \\
  z_+(\r ) &= \sum_{\alpha_0\alpha_1} p(\alpha_0,\alpha_1) S_{\alpha_0}(-x,-s) \otimes S_{\alpha_1}(x,s) \otimes P_1(x|\alpha_0\alpha_1)  \\
               &+ \sum_{\alpha_0\alpha_1\alpha_2} p(\alpha_0,\alpha_1,\alpha_2) S_{\alpha_0}(-x,-s) \otimes S_{\alpha_2}(x,s) \otimes P_1(x|\alpha_0\alpha_1) \otimes P_2(x|\alpha_0\alpha_1\alpha_2)  \\
               &+ \dotsb \\
  z_-(\r ) &= z_+(-\r ),
\end{align*}
where $p(\alpha_0,\dotsc ,\alpha_n)$ denotes the probability of having a sequence of particles of the indicated sizes/shapes and $P_n(x|\alpha_0\dotsc\alpha_n)$ is the probability density of having a particle of type $\alpha_n$ at a (positive) distance $x$ of its nearest neighbor of type $\alpha_{n-1}$ in a sequence of the given order.

In the Size-Spacing Correlation Approximation, one assumes that the particle sequence probabilities are just a product of their individual fractions:
\begin{equation*}
  p(\alpha_0,\dotsc ,\alpha_n) = \prod_i p(\alpha_i),
\end{equation*}
and the nearest neighbor distance distribution is dependent only on the two particles involved:
\begin{equation*}
  P_n(x|\alpha_0\dotsc\alpha_n) = P_1(x|\alpha_{n-1}\alpha_n).
\end{equation*}
Furthermore, the distance distribution $P_1(x|\alpha_0\alpha_1)$ depends on the particle sizes/shapes only through its mean value $D$:
\begin{equation*}
  P_1(x|\alpha_0\alpha_1) = P_0(x - D(\alpha_0,\alpha_1) ),
\end{equation*}
where $D(\alpha_0,\alpha_1) = D_0 + \kappa \left[ \Delta R(\alpha_0) + \Delta R(\alpha_1) \right]$, with $\Delta R(\alpha_i)$ the deviation of a size parameter of particle $i$ with respect to the mean over all particles sizes/shapes and $\kappa$ the coupling parameter.

In momentum space, the sum of convolutions can be written as a geometric series, which can be exactly calculated to be:
\begin{equation}
\label{Esscainf}
I(\q ) = {\bra\left| F_\alpha(\q ) \right| ^2\ket}_{\alpha}
+ 2 \Re \left\lbrace \widetilde{\curlf_\kappa}(\q )
 \widetilde{\curlf_\kappa^*}(\q ) \cdot
 \frac{\Omega_\kappa(\q )}{\tilde{p}_{2\kappa}(\q )\left
   [ 1 - \Omega_\kappa(\q )\right] } \right\rbrace,
\end{equation}
with
\begin{align*}
  \tilde{p}_\kappa(\q ) &= \int d\alpha\; p(\alpha) e^{i\kappa q_x \Delta R(\alpha)}  \\
  \Omega_\kappa(\q ) &= \tilde{p}_{2\kappa}(\q ) \phi(\q) e^{i q_x D_0}  \\
  \widetilde{\curlf_\kappa}(\q ) &= \int d\alpha\; p(\alpha)F_\alpha (\q ) e^{i\kappa q_x \Delta R(\alpha)},
\end{align*}
and the Fourier transform of $P_1(x|\alpha_0\alpha_1)$ is
\begin{equation*}
  \curlp (\q ) = \phi (\q )e^{i q_x D_0} e^{i \kappa q_x \left[ \Delta R(\alpha_0) + \Delta R(\alpha_1) \right] }.
\end{equation*}

Using the result from the one-dimensional analysis, one can apply this formula ad hoc for distributions of particles in a plane, where the coordinate $x$ will now be replaced with $(x,y)$, while the $s$ coordinate encodes a position in the remaining orthogonal direction. One must be aware however that this constitutes a further approximation, since this type of correlation does not have a general solution in more than one dimension.

The intensity in (\ref{Esscainf}) will contain a Dirac delta function contribution, caused by taking an infinite sum of terms that are perfectly correlated at $\q = 0$. One can leverage this behaviour by multiplying the nearest neighbor distribution by a constant factor $e^{-D/\Lambda}$, which removes the division by zero in (\ref{Esscainf}).
Another way of dealing with this infinity at $\q =0$ consists of taking only a finite number of terms, in which case the geometric series still has an analytic solution, but becomes a bit more cumbersome:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
  I(\q ) &= {\bra\left| F_\alpha(\q ) \right| ^2\ket}_\alpha
   + 2 \Re \Biggl\lbrace \frac{1}{\tilde{p}_{2\kappa}(\q )}\widetilde{\curlf_\kappa}(\q )\widetilde{\curlf_\kappa^*}(\q ) \\
  & \times \left[ \left( 1 - \frac{1}{N}\right) \frac{\Omega_\kappa(\q )}{1 - \Omega_\kappa(\q ) } - \frac{1}{N}\frac{\Omega_\kappa^2(\q )\left( 1- \Omega_\kappa^{N-1}(\q )\right) }{\left( 1 - \Omega_\kappa(\q ) \right) ^2 } \right] \Biggr\rbrace.
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
This expression has a well-defined limit for $\Omega_\kappa(\q ) \rightarrow 1$ (when $\q \rightarrow 0$), namely:
\begin{equation*}
  \lim_{\q \rightarrow 0} I(\q ) = {\bra\left| F_\alpha(0 ) \right| ^2\ket}_{\alpha} + \left( N-1 \right) \left| {\bra F_\alpha(0 )\ket}_{\alpha} \right|^2.
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Particles deposited on a substrate}
%===============================================================================
%Substrate modified Born approximation
In this configuration, the particles are sitting on top of a substrate layer, in the air as shown in fig.~\ref{fig:SchemDWBA}. In the DWBA the expression of a form factor becomes
\begin{align}
F_{\rm{DWBA}}(q_{\plll}, k_{i,z}, k_{f,z}) &= F_{\rm{BA}}(q_{\plll}, k_{i,z}-k_{f,z})+ R_i F_{\rm{BA}}(q_{\plll}, -k_{i,z}-k_{f,z}) \nonumber \\
&+ R_f F_{\rm{BA}}(q_{\plll}, k_{i,z}+k_{f,z}) + R_i R_f F_{\rm{BA}}(q_{\plll},-k_{i,z}+k_{f,z}), \label{Edwbaair}
\end{align}
where $q_{\plll}$ is the component of the scattering beam in the plane of the interface ($\q=\k_i-\k_\text{f}$), $k_{i,z}$ and $k_{f,z}$ are the z-component of the incident and scattered beam, respectively. $R_i$, $R_f$ are the reflection coefficients in incidence and reflection. They are defined as\\ $R=\dfrac{k_z+\sqrt{n_s^2k_0^2-|k_{\plll}|^2}}{k_z-\sqrt{n_s^2 k_0^2-|k_{\plll}|^2}}$, where $n_s=1-\delta_s +i \beta_s$ is the refractive index of the substrate, $k_0$ is the wavelength in vacuum ($2\pi /\lambda$), $k_z$ and $k_{\plll}$ are the $z$-component and the in-plane component of $\k_\text{i}$ or $\k_\text{f}$. \\

\ImportantPoint{Remark:}{If the particles are sitting on a multilayered system, the expression of the form factor in the DWBA is obtained by replacing the Fresnel coefficient by the corresponding coefficients of the underlying layers \cite{Par54,BoWo99}.}

Figure~\ref{fig:SchemDWBA} illustrates the four scattering processes for a supported particle, taken into account in the DWBA. The first term of eq.~\ref{Edwbaair}  corresponds to the Born approximation. Each term of $F_{\rm{DWBA}}$ is weighted by a Fresnel coefficient.

The system considered in this section consists of particles encapsulated in a layer, which is sitting on a substrate (see fig.~\ref{fig:SchemDWBAburied}). In this case the form factor in the DWBA is given by

\begin{align}
  F_{\rm{DWBA}}(q_{\plll}, k_{i,z}, k_{f,z})
  &= T_\text{i} T_\text{f} F_{\rm{BA}}(q_{\plll}, k_{i,z}-k_{f,z})e^{i(k_{i,z}-k_{f,z})d}\nonumber \\
  &+ R_\text{i} T_\text{f} F_{\rm{BA}}(q_{\plll}, -k_{i,z}-k_{f,z})e^{i(-k_{i,z}-k_{f,z})d} \nonumber \\
  &+ R_\text{f} T_\text{i} F_{\rm{BA}}(q_{\plll}, k_{i,z}+k_{f,z}) e^{i(k_{i,z}+k_{f,z})d}\nonumber \\
  &+ R_\text{f} R_\text{i}F_{\rm{BA}}(q_{\plll},-k_{i,z}+k_{f,z})e^{i(-k_{i,z}+k_{f,z})d}, \label{Edwbaburied}
\end{align}

\begin{equation*}
R_j =\frac{t^{j}_{0,1}r^{j}_{1,2}\exp(2ik_{j,z}t)}{1+r^{j}_{0,1}r^{j}_{1,2}\exp(2ik_{j,z}t)}, \quad T_j=\frac{t^{j}_{0,1}}{1+r^{j}_{0,1}r^{j}_{1,2}\exp(2ik_{j,z}t)}, j=i,f
\end{equation*}
where $q_{\plll}$ is the component of the scattering beam in the plane of the interface, $k_{i,z}$ and $k_{f,z}$ are the z-component of the incident and scattered beams, respectively.  $d$ is the depth at which the particles are sitting in the layer. Note that this value is given relative to the top of this layer and it is not the coordinate in the absolute referential (linked with the full sample) and it is measured up to the bottom of the particle. $t$ is the thickness of the intermediate layer containing the particles. $R_{i,f}$ and $T_{i,f}$  are the reflection  and transmission coefficients in incidence and reflection (they can be calculated using Parratt or matrix formalism). $r^j_{0,1}$, $r^j_{1,2}$ $t^j_{0,1}$ are the reflection and transmission coefficients between layers; the indices are related to different boundaries with 0: air, 1: intermediate layer and 2: substrate layer and the superscript $j$ is associated with the incident or scattered beams:
\begin{equation*}
r^j_{n,n+1}=\frac{k_{j,z,n}-k_{j,z,n+1}}{k_{j,z,n}-k_{j,z,n+1}}, \qquad t^j_{n,n+1}= \frac{2k_{j,z,n}}{k_{j,z,n}-k_{j,z,n+1}}, \quad n=0,1, \quad j=i,f,
\end{equation*}
where index $n$ is related to the layers, $z$ to the vertical component, and $j$ to the beams (incident and outgoing).

\section{Implementation in \BornAgain}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This section describes the implementation of the interference functions in \BornAgain.
For an implementation of all the components of a simulation,
the use is referred, for example, to Sec.~\ref{sec:Example1Python}.\\


\ImportantPoint{Remark:}{In \BornAgain\ the particles are positioned in the same vertical layer.}

\subsection{Size-distribution models}
\index{Size-distribution models}
The decoupling approximation (DA), local monodisperse approximation (LMA) and size spacing correlation approximation (SSCA) can be used in \BornAgain.
The selection between DA and SSCA is made using\\
\Code{ILayout.setApproximation(EInterferenceFunction approximation)} when defining the characteristics of the way particles and interference functions are embedded in a layer.  For example,
\begin{lstlisting}[language=python, style=eclipseboxed,numbers=none,nolol]
    particle_layout = ParticleLayout()
   ....
# interference approx chosen between: DA (default) and SSCA
    particle_layout.setApproximation(ILayout.DA)
\end{lstlisting}

Note that with the SSCA, the users have to specify the coupling parameter $\kappa$ (with the function \Code{setKappa}), which should be a positive dimensionless value. $\kappa$ characterizes the influence of the neighboring particles' sizes on their distance. If $\kappa=0$, the SSCA reduces to the DA with a radial paracrystal for the interference function.\\

For the LMA, its implementation is automatically done when using more than one layout of particles:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=python, style=eclipseboxed,numbers=none,nolol]
    particle_layout0 = ParticleLayout()
    particle_layout1 = ParticleLayout()
   ....
# association of each particles' layout with materials, form factors
#... and with a material layer
    layer_a = Layer(m_material_a)
    layer_a.addLayout(particle_layout0)
    layer_a.addLayout(particle_layout1)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Interferences}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\index{Interference function}

The interference function is specified when building the sample. It is linked with the particles (shape, material). Examples of implementation are given at the end of each description.

\paragraph{Syntax:}
 \Code{particle\_layout.addInterferenceFunction(interference\_function)},\\ where \Code{particle\_layout} holds the information about the different shapes and their proportions for a given layer of particles, and \Code{interference\_function}  is one of the following expressions:
\begin{itemize}
\item \Code{InterferenceFunctionNone()}
\item \Code{InterferenceFunction1DLattice(lattice\_parameters)}
\item \Code{InterferenceFunctionRadialParaCrystal(peak\_distance, damping\_length)}
\item \Code{InterferenceFunction2DLattice(lattice\_parameters)}
\item \Code{InterferenceFunction2DParaCrystal(length\_1, length\_2, $\alpha$\_lattice, $\xi$, \\ damping\_length)}
\end{itemize}

\ImportantPoint{Remark:}{\Code{InterferenceFunction1DLattice} can only be used for particles which are infinitely long in one direction of the sample's surface like for example a rectangular grating.}

\newpage
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{InterferenceFunctionNone}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The particles are placed randomly in the dilute limit and are considered as individual, non-interacting scatterers. The scattered intensity is function of the form factors only.

\paragraph{Example} The sample is made of a substrate on which are deposited half-spheres. Script~\ref{lst:nointerf} details the commands necessary to generate such a sample. Figure~\ref{fig:nointerf} shows an example of output intensity: Script~\ref{lst:nointerf}  + detector's + input beam's characterizations.

\vspace{12pt}
A probability distribution function \Code{pdf} has to be chosen from the list in section~\ref{baftd} in order to apply some modifications to the scattering peaks. This function is implemented using \Code{setProbabilityDistribution(pdf)}.

\paragraph{Example:} Script~\ref{lst:1dlattinterf} details how to build in  \BornAgain\ a sample using\\ \Code{InterferenceFunction1DLattice} as the interference function. As mentioned previously, this interference function can only be used with infinitely wide or long particles.\\ Here the sample is made of infinitely long boxes deposited on a substrate (these particles are characterized by their widths and heights). They are also rotated by $90^{\circ}$  in the sample surface in order to have their long axis perpendicular to the input beam, which is along the $x$-axis.\\
 The lattice parameters (the lattice length and angle between the lattice main axis and the $x$-axis) are passed into the constructor of the interference function.

Two predefined interference functions can also be used:
\begin{itemize}
\item  \Code{createSquare(peak\_distance, damping\_length, domain\_size\_1, domain\_size\_2)}\\
where the angle between the base vectors of the lattice is set to $\pi/2$,
it creates a squared lattice,
\item \Code{createHexagonal(peak\_distance, damping\_length, domain\_size\_1, domain\_size\_2)}\\
where the angle between the base vectors of the lattice is set to $2\pi/3$ ,
\end{itemize}
where
\Code{domain\_size1, 2} are the dimensions of coherent domains of the paracrystal along the main axes,\\ \Code{peak\_distance} is the same in both directions and $\v{a}\equiv \v{x}$.\\

Probability distribution functions have to be defined. As the two-dimensional paracrystal is defined from two independent one-dimensional paracrystals, we need two of these functions, using\\ \Code{setProbabilityDistributions(pdf\_1, pdf\_2)}, with \Code{pdf\_{1,2}} related to each main axis of the paracrystal (see figure~\ref{fig:2dparaschematic}).
